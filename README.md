# SocialMediaSentiment

Work In Progress :)

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in social media data using a variety of approaches, including traditional sentiment analysis tools, machine learning algorithms, and advanced deep learning models. The goal is to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral by leveraging cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing (NLP). Key components of the project include:

VADER Sentiment Analysis:
A rule-based approach using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, which is well-suited for analyzing social media text due to its handling of slang, emoticons, and punctuation.

Machine Learning Models:
Sentiment classification using supervised learning algorithms. These models are trained on labeled datasets to predict sentiment based on features extracted from text.

Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch:
Advanced sentiment analysis is performed using deep learning frameworks. The project incorporates a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art NLP model known for its context-aware text embeddings and superior performance in sentiment classification tasks.

Comparative Analysis:
The project compares the performance of these different approaches, evaluating their accuracy, precision, and recall. This provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method in handling social media data.

Visualization and Insights:
Results are visualized to highlight trends in sentiment distribution, offering valuable insights into public opinion and behavior on social media platforms.

This project serves as a comprehensive study of sentiment analysis techniques, showcasing how traditional and modern approaches can be used effectively in real-world applications.
